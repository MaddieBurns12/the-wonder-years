    <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            The Wonder Years is an amazing band that I discovered while I was in highschool, and they have been my favorite ever since.
            Google puts them under the genres of 'Pop punk, alternative rock, emo, easycore'. In my opinion,
            these are very broad descriptions and this is a band that is difficult to file under a specific genre.
        <br>
            What I particularly love about The Wonder Years is their songwriting. The lyrics in their songs do an amazing job at 
            speaking to the heart and eliciting strong emotions. I could listen to their songs over and over - I actually often do - 
            and never tire of their music. I think that is a strong indication of good music!

            This is a video to my current favorite song by The Wonder Years. The lyrics, in my opinion, are beautiful,
